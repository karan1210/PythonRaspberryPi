# PythonRaspberryPi
Repository contain the projects with Raspberry Pi, Python and other hardwares. All the details, codes and output images are uploaded in this repository. 

The main idea of this project is to toggle LEDs with normal language (chatting) by using the Telegram application which is based on cloud. 
Telegram allows humans to talk with machine by API Bot. In this project we will use Raspberry pi to connect the GPIO pins with four LEDs and use python code to toggle LED via Telegram Bot. 
Telegram Bot is a robot which can be programmed to interact with user by giving sets of instructions and answer of that. 

Kindly Follow the steps:

Step: 1
Install Telegram and add BotFather on it.

Step: 2
Now write “/start” to start chatting with the bot.

Step: 3
Now write “/newbot’ to request a new bot.
 
Step:4
Next, we have to name our bot and username for the same which should end with _bot, I have named it as Project1bot and Systemintegration_bot respectively.

Note: Save the Token Number, it is used in programming. 

Step:5
Now use python Telegram Bot Raspberry Pi.py  command to toggle the LED with telegram.

Lessons learnt and future work
For future work, Person can connect different biomedical machines instead of LEDs and operate it with telegram Bot.
