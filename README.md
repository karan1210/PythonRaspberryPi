# LED ON/OFF Using Telegram & RaspberryPi
The main idea of this project is to toggle LEDs with normal language (chatting) by using the Telegram application which is based on cloud. 
Telegram allows humans to talk with machine by API Bot. In this project we will use Raspberry pi to connect the GPIO pins with four LEDs and use python code to toggle LED via telegram Bot. Telegram Bot is a robot which can be programmed to interact with user by giving sets of instructions and answer of that.
